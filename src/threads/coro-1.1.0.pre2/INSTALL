	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CORO LIBRARY
		E.Toernig	   25.Feb.1999

The short instructions:

	./configure
	make
	make test
	make -n install
	make install

The longer ones *g*:

	Run the configure script.  It will try to determine
	your system and will generate the makefiles.

	If it is unable to auto detect your system, run

		./configure --help

	It will show you the supported architectures.  Select
	one with

		./configure --arch <archname>

	There are additional options to select the installation
	directories:

	    --prefix <dir>
		Changes the common installation prefix. The
		default is /usr/local.

	    --library <dir>
		Directory where the library libcoro.a is
		installed.  Default is <prefix>/lib.

	    --include <dir>
		Directory where the header file coro.h is
		installed.  Default is <prefix>/include.

	    --manual <dir>
		Directory where the man page is installed.
		Default is <prefix>/man.  The complete
		path is system dependant.  Normally,
		the it is installed as <mandir>/man2/coro.2.

	Next step is to compile the library:

	    make

	It should succeed without errors.  Now there are
	two files in the arch directory: libcoro.a and coro.h.
	These are needed by the next step which is compiling
	and running the test program:

	    make test

	If it finishes with "Test passed" everything is fine
	and you can proceed installing the library.  If it
	fails you are on your own *g*.

	To check the installation directories you may want to
	run

	    make -n install

	and if it is all right the last step:

	    make install

	This installs three files: libcoro.a, coro.h, and
	the coro man page (normally coro.2).


Cleaning up:

	To remove all temporary files execute
	
	    make clean

	To clean up everything (including the Makefiles):

	    make distclean



Happy hacking, ET.
