Executables used during the build process:

  cilly:
    Front end for CIL.  Overrides normal behavior to invoke the stack
    analysis, if requested.

  stacksize:
    Parses gcc x86 assembly output to determine the maximum stack size
    for each function.

  analyzegraph:
    Takes the call graph and the stack sizes (output of above) as input
    and determines which calls need to link new stack chunks.  Prints
    some information about the analyzed graph and outputs stack.h, which
    indicates which edges must be instrumented.
