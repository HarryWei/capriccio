1. cd capriccio/src; make
2. cd httpd-2.0.44; patch -p2 < patchfile
  NOTE (Feng): as of 7/19/03, the patch is no longer needed for the server to work because of the newly implemented signal stuff.

3. CAP=/path/to/capriccio/src

4. configure,
for debugging:

CFLAGS="-I$CAP/include -O2 -g" CPPFLAGS="-I$CAP/include -O2 -g" LDFLAGS="-L$CAP/lib -lcrypt -lm" NOTEST_LDFLAGS="-all-static" ./configure --enable-threads --with-mpm=worker --without-sendfile --disable-cgi --disable-cgid --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix=/home/zf/apache

older version:
CPPFLAGS="-I$CAP/include" LDFLAGS="-L$CAP/lib" NOTEST_LDDFLAGS="-all-static" CFLAGS="-O2 -lcrypt -pthread" ./configure --enable-threads --with-mpm=worker --without-sendfile --disable-cgi --disable-cgid --enable-maintainer-mode

for benchmarking (by jrvb):
CPPFLAGS="-I$CAP/include" LDFLAGS="-L$CAP/lib" NOTEST_LDDFLAGS="-all-static" CFLAGS="-DFD_SETSIZE=16384 -D__stub_semget -D__stub_semctl -D__stub_semop -O2 -lcrypt -pthread" ./configure --enable-threads --with-mpm=worker --without-sendfile --disable-cgi --disable-cgid

4b. old flags (seems not working now, maybe work on Redhat)
CPPFLAGS="-I$CAP/include -static" LDFLAGS="-L$CAP/lib" ./configure --enable-threads --with-mpm=worker --without-sendfile --disable-shared --enable-maintainer-mode --prefix=$HOME/myapache2 --disable-cgi --disable-cgid

5. make
6. run apache with ./httpd -D DEBUG
   one functionallity of -D DEBUG is to make it single process
   multi-process httpd probably doesn't work because signals are used to communicate between them.

This will build a statically linked version of apache, which should
work on all systems.  (the syscall overriding doesn't work on some systems...)


Additional instructions for use with CIL:

1. [check out cil (preferred)]
     cd /path/to/wherever
     cvs -d manju.cs.berkeley.edu:/home/cvs-repository co cil
   [or grab a tarball from largo (may be out of date)]
     cd /path/to/wherever
     scp largo.millennium.berkeley.edu:/home/jcondit/cil.tar.gz .
     tar zxvf cil.tar.gz
2. [configure and build cil]
     cd /path/to/cil
     ./configure --with-blockinggraph
     make
3. [apply cil patch in addition to capriccio patch above]
     cd httpd-2.0.44
     patch -p2 < apache-2.0.44-cil.diff
4. [configure as above, minus the NOTEST_LDFLAGS parameter]
5. [edit CIL and CAP paths in mymake]
6. [run fancy make command]
     chmod u+rx mymake
     ./mymake
7. [run httpd as above]

The patch changes the Makefiles to use CIL instead of libtool, using
the CIL front end checked into the capriccio repository.  This front
end merges all of Apache into a single file and then instruments it
accordingly.

You'll need to have ocaml and python installed.



BUGS:

x heavy loads seem to cause the server to hang

x after prolonged test, apache will fail to serve pages with the following error message
  restarting apache will not help.  seems to be some kernel problem.

    [Tue Mar 11 01:22:44 2003] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: Couldn't create accept lock

x the process will not stop gracefully, you have to kill -9 <pid> each time.  this is because 
  we don't support signal handling yet, which is used to handle broken pipe, graceful shutdown/restart

x (fixed) initgroups() is causing internal error in glibc

x (fixed) we don't have writev(), used by apr_socket_sendfile()




CHANGELOG:

x. change group from #-1 to nobody in httpd.conf

x. change apr_sigwait() in apr_signal_thread to empty apr_thread_yield() calls, because we don't have signal support now

x. (obsolete) in srclib/apr/include/apr.h, turn APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD off



Notes on MPM worker:

worker.c:ap_mpm_run()

-> startup_children
  start a bunch of child processes
